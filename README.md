# Weather or not

This work is the result of a day-long team project during my time at dev-academy bootcamp. We were able to use our skills to gather data from an external API and merge that information with our own database. The result is a web app that would allow you to select a number of activities and a location and get information on wether or not the weather would be suitable for such activities in the next few days.
